      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <h3>Synthesizer</h3>
      <h4>Playing</h4>
      <p>You can play the synthesizer using either the top two rows of your Qwerty keyboard (the "F" key is mapped to the note "F3") or by turning on and off boxes on the grid. To start playing your sequence, simply hit start or navigate to another tab.</p>
      <h4>Settings</h4>
      <h5>Envelope</h5>
      <p>Use the Sliders in the envelope section to adjust the attack, decay, sustain, decay, and release of your sound. For a in-depth explanation of what the parameters do, read this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer#Attack_Decay_Sustain_Release_.28ADSR.29_envelope">article</a>.</p>
      <h5>Portamento, Waveform, and Filters</h5>
      <p>Use the portamento slider to adjust the amount of time it takes for one note to slide to the next. Toggling the waveform with the radio buttons changes the fundamental shape of your sound's wave. You can also decide which frequencies to cut from your sound toggling between the filter types. Adjusting the filter frequency slider determines which frequencies will be attenuated, and adjusting the Q determines the amount of attenuation.</p>
      <h4>Saving/Loading</h4>
      <p>Once you have settings that you like, you can save your "patch" along with any sequence you have written for it. You can also load any of your previously saved or favorited settings with the dropdowns below the save button. It is important to note that loading your own settings does not change the sequence. This allows you to test a sequence with any of your presets. However, loading a patch from the community or user page will load that setting's default sequence.</p>
      <h3>Community</h3>
      <p>Community will show you other patches and users ranked by popularity, most recent, random, etc. Clicking the patch's name will load it into the synth. Clicking on a user's name will load their profile.</p>
